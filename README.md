## Website Performance Optimization Project

This is the 4th project in Udacity's Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree curriculum. The goal of this project is
to make the pages of the given website render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques learned in
Udacity's [Critical Rendering Path](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884) course.

The course is comprised of two main classes:
* [Website Performance Optimization](https://www.udacity.com/course/website-performance-optimization--ud884) and
* [Browser Rendering Optimization](https://www.udacity.com/course/browser-rendering-optimization--ud860).

These classes cover optimizing the set of steps, i.e. the Critical Rendering Path, a browser takes to convert
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a living, breathing website. Google's [Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)
are also covered. This set set of web authoring and debugging tools built into Google Chrome help developer's
efficiently track down layout issues, set JavaScript breakpoints, and get insights for code optimization.
